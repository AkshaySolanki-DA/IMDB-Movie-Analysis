# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an IMDb movie dataset with over 10,000 entries. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we examine key aspects such as ratings distribution, budget vs. revenue relationships, genre trends, and yearly release patterns.

Key features:

Data cleaning and handling of missing values

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of key metrics

Visualizations including scatter plots, boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps

Trend analysis by year and decade

Insights and recommendations on movie trends, popular genres, and performance

This repository is a practical example of using Python for data analysis, perfect for anyone learning EDA or interested in movie industry data.
